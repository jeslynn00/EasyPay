            <h3>Privacy Notice</h3>
            We at EasyPay respect the privacy and confidentiality of the personal data of our clients, customers, visitors and all others whom we interact with in the course of providing our services. While we are driven by the goal of providing customers with an enhanced shopping experience, we also understand that a key concern that customers may have is the safety of their personal information, and are committed to ensuring that all personal data provided to us remain secure and are only utilised for purposes that our customers have consented to.

            To begin with, we only collect such personal information that is necessary to provide you with the services that you have requested, understand your needs, and serve you better as a whole. ​We collect the least information possible. We provide to our merchant partners only such information as is necessary to allow us to verify and track your rewards.

            For example, we utilise cookies to track your transactions with our merchant partners because such information is necessary to enable us to validate and credit Cashback into your ShopBack account.

            Otherwise, we limit any data provided to an aggregate level.

            We do ​not​ under any circumstance sell your information.

            We are committed to implementing policies, practices and processes to safeguard the collection, use, and disclosure of the personal data you provide us, in compliance with the applicable personal data protection legislation.
